Card Processor 0.1!
--------------------------------

I chose to solve this problem utilizing OOP in ruby. I picked ruby because it
is the language I am most comfortable with. I developed two main classes, a Card
class that takes care of all the card functionality and a card processor class
which does all the card processing work. Doing it this way enabled me to focus
first on the card and make sure it was working and then extending it with the
processor.

My code requires the luhn-ruby gem and rspec for running tests. I also used pry
for general debugging while finding a solution.
